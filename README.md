# Trippee

**A travel optimisation tool built by Mimi Manly-Osei**  
Designed to plan the most efficient route across all IKEA, LEGO, and Ivy restaurant locations in the UK and Ireland.

## 🚀 About the Project

Trippee is a personal development project created as part of my journey into backend Python development. Inspired by my own road trip idea, this project blends real-world planning with technical growth — helping me apply core skills in Python, data wrangling, and system design.

It's not just a travel tool — it’s a way of thinking, building, and learning in public.
