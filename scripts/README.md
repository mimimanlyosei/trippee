# ðŸ“‚ /scripts

This folder contains all core Python scripts that power the Trippee logic.

## Examples
- Location parsing
- Route optimisation
- Data processing functions

Each script should be modular and reusable. Link the script to its corresponding issue using `#issueNumber` in the commit message.
