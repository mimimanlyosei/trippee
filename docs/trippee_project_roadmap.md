# 🚀 Trippee Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned phases of development for **Trippee**, from initial MVP through to later feature enhancements and framework integrations.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Objective:** Build a foundational backend system that reads, processes, and visualises travel data between IKEA, LEGO, and Ivy locations.

### Core Deliverables:
- [ ] Parse and clean location data (CSV or JSON)
- [ ] Implement route logic in pseudocode and Python
- [ ] Generate basic route outputs (terminal or JSON)
- [ ] Visualise route using matplotlib or similar
- [ ] Document MVP features and usage

### Optional Enhancements:
- [ ] Flask-based location viewer (`/trippee-flask/`)
- [ ] Flask REST API (`/api/locations`, `/api/route-plan`)

🏷️ Labels used: `MVP`, `feature`, `data`, `testing`, `flask`, `framework-sprint`

---

## 🚧 Phase 2: Iteration & Rebuild

**Objective:** Expand and restructure existing MVP features using Django for long-term scalability.

### Additions & Refactors:
- [ ] Set up Django project structure (`/trippee-django/`)
- [ ] Rebuild location viewer and data output using Django views/templates
- [ ] Create Django models for locations and user trips
- [ ] Replace static file-based approach with database integration (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Document Django implementation and rebuild process

🏷️ Labels used: `framework-rebuild`, `django`, `learning`, `phase-2`

---

## 🔭 Future Ideas (Post-MVP)

- [ ] Add user-generated trip planning (via form inputs)
- [ ] Use APIs (e.g. Google Maps or OpenRouteService) for live routing
- [ ] Export route to file (PDF, JSON, map image)
- [ ] Build front-end interface (streamlit, Flask UI, or React)
- [ ] Deploy publicly via Heroku, Vercel, or Railway

🏷️ Labels used: `enhancement`, `research`, `infrastructure`, `visualisation`

This roadmap evolves alongside your learning and the needs of the project. Each phase builds momentum without blocking progress. 💪
